# Netlify Redirects Configuration

# This file replaces the functionality of .htaccess for Netlify deployments.
# Netlify automatically handles HTTPS for custom domains, so no rule is needed for that.

# Your canonical URL in index.html is non-www (https://el-doradoluxury.netlify.app/).
# Therefore, we are NOT adding a rule to force www.

# This rule handles "clean URLs" or acts as a fallback for single-page applications (SPAs).
# If a requested path doesn't match an existing file or directory, it will serve index.html.
# This is similar to the 'RewriteRule ^ index.html [L]' from your .htaccess.
